custom hook:->  use react query hooks on small applications is really a god way,
but for large apps yopu might to reuse the data fetching logic or code repitition.
for example= same query might be required ina a different component.
one approach is to duplicate the copde part but this is not the best way,

what we need is to create a custom query Hook.
create a custom hook that wraps around usequery hook.
